# AI-Driven Student Engagement Analysis 

## Overview  
This project, **winner of the AGI Hackathon & Best Presentation Prize**, explores how AI-powered interventions can **boost student engagement** in an educational platform. By analyzing behavioral data, we developed **personalized study plans, adaptive notifications, and gamification techniques** to drive sustained participation.  

## Key Features  
- **Data Analysis & User Segmentation**: Identified trends in student engagement and categorized users based on activity and performance.  
- **AI-Powered Personalization**: Implemented tailored notifications and study plans to support low-engagement students.  
- **Gamification Techniques**: Designed leaderboard enhancements, streak-based incentives, and interactive challenges.  
- **Chatbot Optimization**: Improved chatbot responsiveness to encourage active student interaction.  
- **UI/UX Insights**: Proposed enhancements to dashboard navigation based on user activity data.  

## Repository Contents  
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter Notebook containing the **full technical analysis & implementation**.  
- `Tensionflow_PPT.pdf` → Hackathon-winning **presentation slides** explaining our approach and findings.    
- `README.md` → This file, providing an overview of the project.  

## Approach  
1. **User Segmentation**: Categorized students into **active vs. inactive** and **high vs. low performers**.  
2. **Behavioral Insights**: Analyzed weekly engagement patterns to identify drop-off points.  
3. **Intervention Strategies**: Designed personalized engagement techniques to improve retention.  
4. **Evaluation**: Assessed the impact of interventions through statistical analysis and visualization.  

## Results & Impact  
✅ **Users who engaged more frequently showed improved assignment submissions.**  
✅ **Gamification & personalized nudges led to sustained activity beyond Week 2.**  
✅ **Dashboard activity had the highest correlation with student performance.**
