# AI-Driven Student Engagement Analysis 🚀  

## 📌 Overview  
This project, **winner of the AGI Hackathon & Best Presentation Prize**, explores how AI-powered interventions can **boost student engagement** in an educational platform. By analyzing behavioral data, we developed **personalized study plans, adaptive notifications, and gamification techniques** to drive sustained participation.  

## 📊 Key Features  
- **Data Analysis & User Segmentation**: Identified trends in student engagement and categorized users based on activity and performance.  
- **AI-Powered Personalization**: Implemented tailored notifications and study plans to support low-engagement students.  
- **Gamification Techniques**: Designed leaderboard enhancements, streak-based incentives, and interactive challenges.  
- **Chatbot Optimization**: Improved chatbot responsiveness to encourage active student interaction.  
- **UI/UX Insights**: Proposed enhancements to dashboard navigation based on user activity data.
